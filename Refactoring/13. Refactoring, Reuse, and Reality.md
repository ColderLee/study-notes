### Reducing the Overhead of Refactoring
- Tools and technologies are available to allow refactoring to be done quickly and relatively
painlessly.
- Experiences reported by some object-oriented programmers suggest that the overhead
of refactoring is more than compensated by reduced efforts and intervals in other phases
of program development.
- Although refactoring may seem a bit awkward and an overhead item at first, as it
becomes part of a software development regimen, it stops feeling like overhead and
starts feeling like an essential.

### Refactoring Safely
- Trust your coding abilities.
- Trust that your compiler will catch errors that you miss.
- Trust that your test suite will catch errors that you and your compiler miss.
- Trust that code review will catch errors that you, your compiler, and your test suite miss.

#### real-world concerns regarding a reuse program
- Technical staff may not understand what to reuse or how to reuse it.
- Technical staff may not be motivated to apply a reuse approach unless short-term
benefits can be achieved.
- Overhead, learning curve, and discovery cost issues must be addressed for a reuse
approach to be successfully adopted.
- Adopting a reuse approach should not be disruptive to a project; there may be strong
pressures to leverage existing assets or implementation albeit with legacy constraints.
New implementations should interwork or be backward compatible with existing systems.
