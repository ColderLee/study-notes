Vim provides a convenient shortcut for setting the range of a :[range]!{filter} command such as this.
> <C-z> / jobs

```
:write !sh
:write ! sh
:write! sh

The first two commands pass the contents of the buffer as standard input to
the external sh command. The last command writes the contents of the buffer
to a file called sh by calling the :write! command.

:write !sh   :   each line of the current buffer is executed in the shell.
```
